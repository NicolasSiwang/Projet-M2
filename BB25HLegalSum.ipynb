      "     The Federal Power Act (FPA or Act), 41 Stat. 1063, as amended, 16 U. S. C. §791a  etseq. , authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC or Commission) to superintend the sale of electricity ininterstate commerce and provides that all wholesale-electricityrates must be “just and reasonable,” §824d(a). Under this Court’s Mobile-Sierra  doctrine, FERC must presume that a rate setby “a freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract” meets thestatutory “just and reasonable” requirement.  Morgan StanleyCapital Group Inc.  v.  Public Util. Dist. No. 1 ofSnohomish Cty. , 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 1).“The presumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that thecontract seriously harms the public interest.”  Ibid.\n",
      "     As this Court recognized in  Southland Corp.  v.  Keating ,  465 U. S. 1  (1984), theFederal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. §1  etseq . (2000 ed. and Supp. V), establishes a national policyfavoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode ofdispute resolution. The Act, which rests on Congress’ authorityunder the Commerce Clause, supplies not simply a proceduralframework applicable in federal courts; it also calls for theapplication, in state as well as federal courts, of federalsubstantive law regarding arbitration. 465 U. S., at 16. Morerecently, in  Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.  v. Cardegna ,  546 U. S. 440  (2006),the Court clarified that, when parties agree to arbitrate alldisputes arising under their contract, questions concerning thevalidity of the entire contract are to be resolved by thearbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or statecourt.\n"
